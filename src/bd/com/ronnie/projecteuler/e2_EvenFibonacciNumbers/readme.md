# Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

[From HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler002/problem)

This problem is a programming version of [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with  and , the first  terms will be:

    1,2,5,8,13,21,34,...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed , find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Input Format**

First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

**Constraints**

    1 <= T <= 10^5
    1 <= N <= 10^16

**Output Format**

Print the required answer for each test case.

**Sample Input 0**

    2
    10
    100

**Sample Output 0**

    10
    44

**Explanation 0**

For N = 10, we have {2, 8}, sum is 10.
For N = 100, we have {2, 8, 34}, sum is 44.


## Solution
